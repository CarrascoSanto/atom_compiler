Everything here is for Linux. If you want to test the generation of executables in this language, follow the instructions below.

Make sure you have the following installed on your Linux:
- Python 3;
- Lark;
- Clang;

Run parser_lark.py, it will run and generate a file called "output_precedence.ll" which is an LLVM file (intermediate low-level language - lower level than C, but not as low as Assembly);

Then, run the command:
clang -fPIE output_precedence.ll runtime.c -o program_atom

It will generate a native Linux binary, run it:
./program_atom

It will print the test code from the parser_lark.py file on the screen.
